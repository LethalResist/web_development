          The Cathedral of Santa María la Menor, holds a distinguished place in history as the oldest cathedral in the Americas. Construction began in 1514 under the orders of Pope Julius II and was completed in 1541. Located in the heart of Santo Domingo's Zona Colonial, this cathedral was built from golden-tinted coral limestone, giving it a unique and enduring beauty. Its design reflects a blend of Gothic and Renaissance architectural styles, showcasing the influence of Spanish colonization. The cathedral's interior is equally impressive, with a stunning altar made of silver and mahogany, and various chapels adorned with religious art and artifacts.

          Throughout its history, Santa Maria Cathedral has witnessed significant events that shaped the Dominican Republic. It served not only as a religious center but also as a fortress during times of conflict, such as the pirate attacks in the 16th century. The cathedral was also the resting place of Christopher Columbus's remains for a period, before they were transferred to the Columbus Lighthouse in Santo Domingo. Today, the cathedral remains an active place of worship and a major tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the world who come to admire its historical and architectural significance. Its enduring presence stands as a testament to the rich cultural heritage and history of Santo Domingo.
